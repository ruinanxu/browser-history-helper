Browser History Helper is an extension that helps users retrieve webpages from their browser history using Machine Learning models. Specifically, the model can perform semantic similarity searches given a query.

Additionally, the model generates tags for your history items, allowing you to filter results more effectively.

We also support customizing tags, enabling users to define their own tag sets to better suit their needs. Currently, we use a distilled BERT uncased model from ðŸ¤— Transformers.
